## Conventional Commits

We enforce the usage of conventional commits in this repository. Please ensure that your commit messages follow the conventional commits format. You can find more information about conventional commits [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

## Code Formatting

We use the following tools for code formatting:
- [Black](https://github.com/psf/black): Python code formatter.
- [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort): Python import sorter.
- [docformatter](https://github.com/PyCQA/docformatter): Docstring formatter.

Please make sure that your code adheres to these formatting standards before submitting a pull request.

## Linting

We utilize the following tools for linting:
- [pycln](https://github.com/hadialqattan/pycln): Cleaner for Python code. It removes unused imports and unused variables.
- [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy): Static type checker for Python.
- [pylint](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint): Python code quality checker.

Ensure that your code passes linting checks without any errors or warnings.

## Docstring Checks

We maintain high-quality docstrings in our codebase. To ensure consistency and correctness, we have a `check` makefile rule under `docs/Makefile` that exploits `pylint` with enablers for docstrings (C0114, C0115, C0116).

Please run the docstring check before submitting your changes to ensure that your docstrings meet our standards. You can execute the following command from the root directory of the repository:

```bash
cd docs
make check
```

## Pre-commit Hooks
Apart from docstring checks, we provide pre-commit hooks to automate the process of enforcing code formatting, linting, and other checks mentioned above. Follow the steps below to install and run the pre-commit hooks:

2. **Install pre-commit hooks:** Once pre-commit is installed, navigate to the root directory of the repository and run the following command:

    ```bash
    pre-commit install
    ```

    This will set up pre-commit hooks for your local repository.

3. **Run pre-commit checks:** You can now run all pre-commit checks on your changes before committing them. Use the following command:

    ```bash
    pre-commit run --all-files
    ```

    You can also use the Makefile rule `check` to run the pre-commit checks:

    ```bash
    make check
    ```

    This command will execute all pre-commit hooks on all files in your repository. Any issues found will be reported, and you'll need to address them before committing your changes.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your changes adhere to our coding standards and guidelines before committing them. If you encounter any issues or have questions about the pre-commit setup, feel free to reach out to us for assistance.
